Installation
------------

### Install

```sh
composer require lookyman/nette-proxy
```

### Config

```yaml
extensions: 
	proxy: Lookyman\Nette\Proxy\DI\ProxyExtension
	
proxy:
	proxyDir: %appDir%/../temp/proxies # this is the default value
	default: off # turn on to proxy everything
```

### Usage

Tag services with `lookyman.lazy` and they get magically proxied.

```yaml
services: 
	-
		class: MyHeavyService
		tags: [lookyman.lazy]
```

If you have `proxy.default` turned on and you don't want a particular service to be proxied, you can do it like this:

```yaml
services: 
	-
		class: DontProxyMeService
		tags: [lookyman.lazy: off]
```

Proxying certain Nette services is automaticaly disabled due to [known limitations](https://ocramius.github.io/ProxyManager/docs/lazy-loading-value-holder.html#known-limitations).

### Pre-generating proxies

Proxy generation causes I/O operations and uses a lot of reflection, so it is handy to have them pre-generated before the application starts. For this, install Symfony/Console integration (such as [Contributte/Console](https://github.com/contributte/console)) and run:

```sh
php www/index.php lookyman:nette-proxy:generate
```
